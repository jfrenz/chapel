/* This module provides support for reporting and counting communication
   operations between network-connected locales.  The operations include
   various kinds of remote reads (GETs), remote writes (PUTs), and
   remote forks.  Callers can request on-the-fly output each time a
   remote operation occurs, or count such operations as they occur and
   retrieve the counts later.  The former gives more detailed
   information but has much more overhead.  The latter has much less
   overhead but only provides aggregate information.

   All forms of communication reporting and counting are done between
   pairs of function calls that turn it on and off.  On-the-fly
   reporting across all locales is done like this::

     startVerboseComm();
     // between start/stop calls, report comm ops initiated on any locale
     stopVerboseComm();

   On-the-fly reporting for a single locale is done like this::

     startVerboseCommHere();
     // between start/stop calls, report comm ops initiated on this locale
     stopVerboseCommHere();

   In either case, the output produced consists of a line written to
   ``stdout`` for each communication operation.  (Here ``stdout`` means
   the file associated with the process, not the Chapel channel with the
   same name.)

   Counting communication operations requires a few more calls then just
   reporting them does.  In particular, the counts have to be retrieved
   after they are collected and, if they have been used previously, the
   internal counters have to be reset before counting is turned on.
   Counting across all locales is done like this::

     // (optional) if we counted previously, reset the counters to zero
     resetCommDiagnostics();
     startCommDiagnostics();
     // between start/stop calls, count comm ops initiated on any locale
     stopCommDiagnostics();
     // retrieve the counts and report the results
     writeln(getCommDiagnostics());

   Counting on just the calling locale is similar.  Only the procedure
   names change::

     // (optional) if we counted previously, reset the counters to zero
     resetCommDiagnosticsHere();
     startCommDiagnosticsHere();
     // between start/stop calls, count comm ops initiated on this locale
     stopCommDiagnosticsHere();
     // retrieve the counts and report the results
     writeln(getCommDiagnosticsHere());

   The optional call to reset the counters is only needed when a program
   collects counts more than once.  In this case, the counters have to
   be set back to zero before starting the second and succeeding
   counting periods.  By far the most common situation is that programs
   only collect communication counts once per run, in which case this
   step is not needed.

   Note that the same internal mechanisms and counters are used for
   counting on all locales and counting on just the calling locale, so
   trying to do both at once may lead to surprising turn-on/turn-off
   behavior and/or incorrect results.
